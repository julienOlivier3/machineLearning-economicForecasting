**Abstract**:<br/>
Macroeconomic forecasters often show a poor track record in producing reliable predictions. Especially times of economic crises have been consistently missed by traditional forecasting models, which is why the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 caught many people by surprise. Theory-based models and pure time series formulations, both traditionally used in macroeconomic forecasting, suffer the curse of dimensionality when being confronted with a high dimensional space of possible predictors. In times of increasing data availability, this opens the way to rethink macroeconomic forecasting. This paper analyzes the application of machine learning methods in forecasting real GDP growth. Machine learning poses a natural extension to the more traditional models because it is designed to extract information from high dimensional feature spaces. Moreover, machine learning methods are nonlinear by construction which allows to capture nonlinear relations typically encountered among macroeconomic variables in recessions. Given the failure of existing forecasting models and the advantages of machine learning, the goal of this paper is to assess to which extent machine learning algorithms may contribute to the challenge of macroeconomic forecasting.
